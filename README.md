# 🔥 Calories Burned Prediction Using ML & ANN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the number of calories burned during a workout based on user inputs like **age**, **weight**, **height**, **duration**, and **gender**. It compares traditional Machine Learning algorithms with **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** — with ANN showing superior performance.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project contains biometric and workout-related features of individuals. Below is a preview of the first few rows:

| User_ID   | Gender | Age | Height | Weight | Duration | Heart_Rate | Body_Temp | Calories |
|-----------|--------|-----|--------|--------|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| 14733363  | male   | 68  | 190.0  | 94.0   | 29.0     | 105.0      | 40.8      | 231.0    |
| 14861698  | female | 20  | 166.0  | 60.0   | 14.0     | 94.0       | 40.3      | 66.0     |
| 11179863  | male   | 69  | 179.0  | 79.0   | 5.0      | 88.0       | 38.7      | 26.0     |
| 16180408  | female | 34  | 179.0  | 71.0   | 13.0     | 100.0      | 40.5      | 71.0     |
| 17771927  | female | 27  | 154.0  | 58.0   | 10.0     | 81.0       | 39.8      | 35.0     |

Each row represents one workout session with corresponding physiological data and calories burned.

## 📈 EDA Questions for Fitness Dataset

### 1. General Information
- What is the total number of unique users in the dataset?
- What is the gender distribution of users?
- Are there any missing values in any of the columns?

### 2. Statistical Summary
- What is the mean, median, and standard deviation of Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart Rate, Body Temp, and Calories?
- Are there any outliers in the numerical columns?

### 3. Relationship-Based Analysis
- How does workout Duration affect Calories burned?
- Is there a correlation between Heart Rate and Calories burned?
- Does Body Temperature change significantly with Age or workout Duration?

### 4. Grouped Comparisons
- What is the average Calories burned by Gender?
- How does the average Heart Rate vary across different Age groups?
- Is there a trend in Calories burned with increasing Age?
